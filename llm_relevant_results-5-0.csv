Context: Radu Bădica (? – 19 January 1524) was the son of Radu IV the Great and Prince of Wallachia from November 1523 until January 1524.
Ștefan Dimitrescu( January 18, 1886 – May 22, 1933) was a Romanian Post-impressionist painter and draftsman.
Ștefan I. Nenițescu (October 8, 1897–October 1979) was a Romanian poet and aesthetician. Born in Bucharest, his parents were the poet Ioan S. Nenițescu and his wife Elena (""née"" Ștefan). He attended Sapienza University of Rome from 1920, as well as the literature and philosophy department of Bucharest University. At first an assistant professor of aesthetics, he later became an associate professor at Bucharest. He served as press secretary and later economic adviser to the Romanian legation in The Hague. Nenițescu's first publication was a 1915 article about William Shakespeare that appeared in ""Noua revistă română"". His first book of poetry, ""Denii"" (1919), was followed by ""Vrajă"" (1923) and ""Ode italice"" (1925). His single volume of theatre was ""Trei mistere"" (1922). From 1924, he wrote for ""Gândirea"", and was a founding member of Romania's PEN Club. He also contributed poetry and art criticism to ""Convorbiri LiterareIdeea europeanăVremeaUniversul literarViața RomâneascăAdevărul"" and ""Arta plastică"". In 1925, Nenițescu published a treatise, ""Istoria artei ca filosofie a istoriei"". He translated from Benedetto Croce (""Aesthetic"", 1922) and Niccolò Machiavelli (""The Mandrake"", 1926). Initially, Nenițescu's poetry was discursive and religious, in line with the ""Gândirist"" current. His verse became progressively more hermetic, as can be seen in the anthology volume ""Ani"" (1973). Including texts published in the 1940s and '50s, it reveals the intellectualized lyric verse of an eminently classical nature.

Who is the maternal grandfather of Antiochus X Eusebes?,Ptolemy IX Lathyros,,False,"Antiochus IX Eusebes Cyzicenus (""Antiochus the Pious, the Cyzicene"") was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom. He was the son of Antiochus VII Sidetes and Cleopatra Thea. He left the kingdom in 129 BC and went to the city of Cyzicus, but he returned in 116 BC to challenge his half-brother Antiochus VIII for power. The siblings fought a twenty-year civil war. In 112 BC, Antiochus IX's wife, Cleopatra IV, was killed by her sister Tryphaena, the wife of Antiochus VIII. Tryphaena herself died shortly afterwards. Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96 BC; he was succeeded by his sons Seleucus VI and Demetrius III. Antiochus IX then took the capital Antioch and married his deceased wife's sister Cleopatra Selene, who was herself the widow of Antiochus VIII. Seleucus VI continued the war against his uncle. Antiochus IX Eusebes Cyzicenus was killed in battle in 96 BC.
Antiochus( 221 BC – 193 BC) was a Seleucid prince, first- born child to the Seleucid monarchs Antiochus III the Great and Laodice III, and his father's first heir.
Antiochus VII Euergetes (c.164/160 BC - 129 BC) , nicknamed Sidetes  (from Side, a city in Asia Minor), also known as Antiochus the Pious, was ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire who reigned from July/August 138 to 129 BC. He was the last Seleucid king of any stature. After Antiochus was killed in battle, the Seleucid realm was restricted to Syria.
Laodice was a Queen of an unknown Kingdom in Asia. She lived at the time of the Seleucid king of Syria Antiochus X Eusebes who reigned 95 BC- 92 or 88 BC.
Laodice (fl. late 3rd – early 2nd centuries BCE) was a Greek Princess from the Seleucid Empire and the wife of King Mithridates III of Pontus. Laodice appears to have come from obscure origins. Laodice could have been a supposed daughter of the Seleucid King Antiochus IV Epiphanes. This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who appeared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates III. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this marriage to his sister-wife Laodice IV and his other daughter was Antiochis the child from his concubine. However this assumption shows that Antiochus IV Epiphanes may have had another daughter called Laodice, however this is not certain. The assumption shows that there could some confusion about the identity of this Laodice and Laodice VI. Laodice bore Mithridates III three children: Mithridates IV of Pontus, Pharnaces I of Pontus and Laodice.",

The story begins with the death of a model worker, who is buried with his labor card as a badge of honor. However, his widow is told she needs that card to claim the benefits she is entitled to.

Mikhail Dmitriyevich Gaydamak( born 21 November 1996) is a Russian football player who plays for Volna Pinsk.
Arcadi Aleksandrovich Gaydamak (born 8 April 1952 in Moscow, USSR) is a Russian-born French-Israeli businessman, philanthropist, and President of the Congress of Jewish Religious Communities and Organizations of Russia (KEROOR). He emigrated to Israel at the age of 20 and lived on a kibbutz, then moved to France and opened a translation bureau. In the 1990s he was awarded the French ""Ordre national du Mérite"" and the ""Ordre du Mérite agricole"" for actions taken to rescue personnel in the War in Bosnia. In the AngolaGate scandal, he was convicted of failure to declare income. On November 24, 2015, he started serving a prison sentence at Fresnes prison in France for that tax issue. In the early 21st century, Gaydamak returned to Israel, where he founded Social Justice, a movement that became a political party. He ran for mayor of Jerusalem but did not win. He bought Hapoel Jerusalem, a professional basketball club. He also bought two newspapers, one in France and one in Russia. He directed the latter to take a pro-government/Vladimir Putin editorial stance. In Israel he has been a generous philanthropist.
Alexandre ""Sacha"" Gaydamak (born May 1976 in France) is a French and Israeli businessman. A member of the wealthy Gaydamak family, he is the only son of Arcadi Gaydamak. In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandarić. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandarić remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be £32,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent £2.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.

Master Ghulam Haider
,  (1908 – 9 November 1953) was a well-known music composer who worked both in India and later in Pakistan after independence. He changed the face of film songs by combining the popular Raags with the verve and rhythm of Punjabi music, and also helped raise the status of film music directors. He is also known for giving a break to the well-known playback singer, Lata Mangeshkar. In an interview, Lata Mangeshkar herself disclosed on her 84th birthday in 2013, ""Ghulam Haider is truly my Godfather. It was his confidence in me that he fought for me to tuck me into the Hindi Film Industry which otherwise had rejected me"". Remembering her early rejection, Lata once said, ""Ghulam Haider was the first music director who showed complete faith in my talent. He introduced me to many producers including ""S. Mukerji"", a big name in film production, but when he too declined me, Ghulam Haider was very furious. Hence, finally he convinced Bombay Talkies, a banner bigger than S. Mukerji and introduced me through their movie Majboor (1948 film)"".",

What is the place of birth of Eiludd Powys's father?,Wales,"[/INST] Yes I will reason and generate the answer </s><s>[INST] Question: What is the place of birth of Eiludd Powys's father?
Context: Beli ap Eiludd was a 7th-century King of Powys. Some theories assert that he was in fact the son of Manwgan ap Selyf who regained power after Eiludd Powys was killed at the battle of Battle of Maes Cogwy in 642. It is more likely however that as the genealogies state he was the son of Eiludd who was either the son or brother of Selyf, the former being the most likely due to a surviving reference from Cynddelw painting the Mathrafal dynasty as being descendants of Selyf. It was also likely if Eiludd Powys fought at Maes Cogwy alongside Elfan Powys and Cynddylan, Beli would have been the King whom Heledd ran to for protection.
Eiludd Powys was an early 7th-century King of Powys. One theory asserts that when Manwgan ap Selyf came to the throne in 613 he was a young boy, which led to an invasion of Powys by Eluadd ap Glast (alias Eiludd Powys), the erstwhile King of Dogfeiling. The usurper probably managed to hold the throne for some thirty years or more before he was killed fighting the Northumbrians, possibly at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. The Dogfeiling dynasty was finally crushed by the Saxons around 656. He was more likely the son or younger brother of Selyf ""Sarffgadau"" ap Cynan Garwyn. It is not known which he is as there are two accounts one in the Jesus College Ms.20 that makes him the son of Selyf and brother of Manwgan whereas the Harleian Ms. 3859 makes him the brother of Selyf Sarffgadau, he could be either as it is not unheard of that a brother succeeds in absence of a mature heir (see Rhyddfedd Frych), as well as the eldest being overlooked as successor by their father (see Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr and Dafydd ap Llywelyn). But what is interesting is a reference to the descendants of Selyf, serpents of Battle by the Powysian Court Poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr and that he specifically during this time of the 12th Century worked for the Powysian Royal family and then after their fall, went to work under Gwynedd and then later Powys Wenwynwyn.

Alternative proposals for the etymology of *Slověninъ propounded by some scholars have much less support. Lozinski argues that the word *slava once had the meaning of worshipper, in this context meaning ""practicer of a common Slavic religion,"" and from that evolved into an ethnonym. S.B. Bernstein speculates that it derives from a reconstructed Proto-Indo-European *(s)lawos, cognate to Ancient Greek λαός laós ""population, people,"" which itself has no commonly accepted etymology. Meanwhile, others have pointed out that the suffix -enin indicates a man from a certain place, which in this case should be a place called Slova or Slava, possibly a river name. The Old East Slavic Slavuta for the Dnieper River was argued by Henrich Bartek (1907–1986) to be derived from slova and also the origin of Slovene.
Like most Slavic languages, there are mostly three genders for nouns: masculine, feminine, and neuter, a distinction which is still present even in the plural (unlike Russian and, in part, the Čakavian dialect).

Which country Anthemiolus's father is from?,Roman Empire,Anthemius's father is from Rome.,False,"The Aeneid and Livy's early history are the best extant sources for Rome's founding myths. Material from Greek heroic legend was grafted onto this native stock at an early date. The Trojan prince Aeneas was cast as husband of Lavinia, daughter of King Latinus, patronymical ancestor of the Latini, and therefore through a convoluted revisionist genealogy as forebear of Romulus and Remus. By extension, the Trojans were adopted as the mythical ancestors of the Roman people.
Even as the Western Roman empire collapsed, literate men acknowledged that Virgil was a master poet. Gregory of Tours read Virgil, whom he quotes in several places, along with some other Latin poets, though he cautions that ""we ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death.""
Romulus (fl. 469–479 AD) was a member of the House of Theodosius, son of Western Roman Emperor Anthemius.
Anthemius (– 11 July 472) was Western Roman Emperor from 467 to 472. Perhaps the last capable Western Roman Emperor, Anthemius attempted to solve the two primary military challenges facing the remains of the Western Roman Empire: the resurgent Visigoths, under Euric, whose domain straddled the Pyrenees; and the unvanquished Vandals, under Geiseric, in undisputed control of North Africa.

Earlier the same year, Siegel made his directorial debut on another short film ""Star in the Night"" (1945), which also won an Academy Award.
Will Hay shared directorial credit with Basil Dearden following on from their previous collaboration, The Black Sheep of Whitehall. Art Director, Michael Relph described Dearden and Hay's input as directors 'Basil was very expert at directing comedy, and that is what he contributed when working with Will Hay. Hay was important as a star, and he could more or less dictate what he wanted to direct, but really he did not direct. Basil directed and supplied all the expertise that Hay probably lacked.' Barry Morse who played Kurt had a slightly different take on the directorial responsibilities. 'Basil Dearden was largely concerned with purely technical things, angles, lenses, lighting details. He didn't have a very active part, it seemed to me, in the actual performance directing.

Will Hay shared directorial credit with Basil Dearden following on from their previous collaboration, The Black Sheep of Whitehall. Art Director, Michael Relph described Dearden and Hay's input as directors 'Basil was very expert at directing comedy, and that is what he contributed when working with Will Hay. Hay was important as a star, and he could more or less dictate what he wanted to direct, but really he did not direct. Basil directed and supplied all the expertise that Hay probably lacked.' Barry Morse who played Kurt had a slightly different take on the directorial responsibilities. 'Basil Dearden was largely concerned with purely technical things, angles, lenses, lighting details. He didn't have a very active part, it seemed to me, in the actual performance directing. That was something which Will Hay had a certain amount to do with.'""The Goose Steps Out"" is also noted as the film debut of a young Peter Ustinov.

The following year, Liu Zuan was poisoned by the general Liang Ji. General Liang was also the reason why Lady Chen was not given the status of either an empress, a royal wife or an empress Dowager.

She was a concubine of Emperor Xuan, and she was the mother of his son and crown prince Xiao Kui. Xiao Kui was not initially considered Emperor Xuan's heir, as Emperor Xuan had an older son Xiao Liao (蕭嶚), who was initially his heir apparent. However, by the time that Emperor Xuan took the throne with Western Wei support in 555, Xiao Liao had already died, and so Xiao Kui, as the next son, was created crown prince.

Context: Robert Adam (3 July 1728 – 3 March 1792) was a Scottish neoclassical architect, interior designer and furniture designer. He was the son of William Adam (1689–1748), Scotland's foremost architect of the time, and trained under him. With his older brother John, Robert took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the Board of Ordnance, after William's death. In 1754, he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under Charles-Louis Clérisseau and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. On his return to Britain he established a practice in London, where he was joined by his younger brother James. Here he developed the ""Adam Style"", and his theory of ""movement"" in architecture, based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country. Adam held the post of Architect of the King's Works from 1761 to 1769. Robert Adam was a leader of the first phase of the classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death. He influenced the development of Western architecture, both in Europe and in North America. Adam designed interiors and fittings as well as houses. He served as the member of Parliament for Kinross-shire from 1768 to 1774.
John Adam( 5 March 1721 – 25 June 1792) was a Scottish architect.
James Adam (21 July 1732 – 20 October 1794) was a Scottish architect and furniture designer, but was often overshadowed by his older brother and business partner, Robert Adam. They were sons of architect William Adam. In 1755 James worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth. In 1758, Robert, James, and their younger brother William Adam started their business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs. He then followed in Robert's footsteps by undertaking the ""Grand Tour"", leaving in May 1760 to October 1763, when he arrive back in London. James succeeded Robert as Architect of the King's Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers' Adelphi project (1768–1772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739–1808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781). From 1771–5 he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire. James emerged from his brother's shadow after Robert's death in 1792, designing several notable buildings in Glasgow, including the old Infirmary (1792; demolished 1907), Assembly Rooms (1794; demolished in 1890) and the Tron Kirk (1794). He also designed Portland Place in central London. However, his glory was short-lived — he died at his home in London's Albermarle Street in October 1794. During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, ""Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam"" (in 1773–1778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).

Along with Professor Mark Lester (Gabriele Tinti), the two travel to the Amazon with a team to discover the source of the long-thought-extinct tribe that still practices cannibalism today. The film is an entry in the ""Black Emanuelle"" series and features elements of cannibal films which had just gained popularity after the release of ""Ultimo mondo cannibale"" (1977). D'Amato referred it in an interview as ""a reasonable commercial success, especially abroad"".

The story beautifully captures the quiet desperation of the two protagonists, their dissatisfaction with their meaningless lives and loveless marriages, and their craving for something better. Their deep love for each other fills that void and radically transforms their outlook on life. But that love also breaks their hearts, for, in 19th century Russia, they find it almost impossible to break away and start a new life together.

With inferior numbers, during the Polish–Swedish War (1626–29), Koniecpolski stopped the Swedish forces of Gustavus Adolphus from conquering Prussia and Pomerania before the war was concluded with the Truce of Altmark. In 1634, he defeated a major Turkish invasion at Kamianets-Podilskyi (Kamieniec Podolski), in modern Ukraine, while in 1644, his victory against the Tatars at the Battle of Ochmatów brought him international fame and recognition.
Aleksander Koniecpolski( 1555–1609) was a voivode( palatine) of Sieradz, a staunch supporter of king Sigismund III Vasa of the House of Vasa. He was the son of Stanisław Przedbór Koniecpolski and Elżbieta Ligzianka( relative of hetman Jan Tarnowski). His wife was Anna Sroczycka, daughter of Stanisław Sroczycki, voivode of Kamieniec. This marriage brought into the Koniecpolscy family large estates at Podolia. He had six children:
Aleksander Dominik Kazanowski( 1605 – February 1648), was a noble( szlachcic), magnate, voivode of Bracław Voivodeship in the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth. Before 6 November 1646 he became a voivode of Bracław. He married Anna Potocka. They had two daughters: Helena and Maria Anna Kazanowska( 1643 – 1687), wife of Stanisław Jan Jabłonowski.
Prince Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620–1659) was a Polish nobleman. He became the Grand Standard-Bearer of the Crown in 1641, the Palatine of Sandomierz Voivodeship in 1656, and the Starost of Perejasław, Korsun, Płoskirow and Dolina. He was the son of the famous hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski. During the Chmielnicki Uprising, he was elected as one of the regimentarz of Pospolite ruszenie and took part in the losing battle of Pyliavtsi in 1648.",

Where was the place of burial of Neith (Wife Of Pepi Ii)'s husband?,Saqqara,"[/INST] Yes I will reason and generate the answer </s><s>[INST] Question: Where was the place of burial of Neith (Wife Of Pepi Ii)'s husband?
Context: Ankhesenpepi IV was an ancient Egyptian queen, a wife of Pharaoh Pepi II of the Sixth dynasty. She was the mother of King Neferkare II. Pepi II also had several other wives.
Neith was an ancient Egyptian queen consort, one of the principal queens of the Old Kingdom pharaoh Pepi II Neferkare, who ruled (c. 2278 BC – c. 2184 BC). Queen Neith was named after goddess Neith.
Ankhesenpepi II or Ankhesenmeryre II was a queen consort during the sixth dynasty of Egypt. She was the wife of Kings Pepi I and Merenre Nemtyemsaf I, and the mother of Pepi II. She was buried in a pyramid in Saqqara.
Pepi II (also Pepy II; 2284 BC – after 2247 BC, probably either 2216 or 2184 BC) was a pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty in Egypt's Old Kingdom who reigned from 2278 BC. His throne name, Neferkare (""Nefer-ka-Re""), means ""Beautiful is the Ka of Re"". He succeeded to the throne at age six, after the death of Merenre I. He was traditionally thought to be the son of Pepi I and Queen Ankhesenpepi II but the South Saqqara Stone annals record that Merenre had a minimum reign of 11 years. Several 6th dynasty royal seals and stone blocks—the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II—were discovered in the 1999/2000 excavation season at Saqqara which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife. Inscriptions on these stone blocks give Ankhesenpepi II the royal titles of: ""King's Wife of the Pyramid of Pepy I, King's Wife of the Pyramid of Merenre, King's Mother of the Pyramid of Pepy II"". Therefore, today, many Egyptologists believe that Pepi II was likely Merenre's own son. Pepi II would, therefore, be Pepi I's grandson while Merenre was, most likely, Pepi II's father since he is known to have married Pepi II's known mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi II. This would also conform well with the evidence from the South Saqqara Stone which shows no coregency between the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre thus making it far more likely that Pepi II was Merenre's own son. Pepi II's reign marked a sharp decline of the Old Kingdom. As the power of the nomarchs grew, the power of the pharaoh declined. With no dominant central power, local nobles began raiding each other's territories and the Old Kingdom came to an end within mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign.
Iput was an ancient Egyptian queen consort of the Sixth dynasty, a sister and wife of Pepi II.

Several 6th dynasty royal seals and stone blocks—the latter of which were found within the funerary temple of Queen Ankhesenpepi II, the known mother of Pepi II—were discovered in the 1999/2000 excavation season at Saqqara which demonstrate that she also married Merenre after Pepi I's death and became this king's chief wife. Inscriptions on these stone blocks give Ankhesenpepi II the royal titles of: ""King's Wife of the Pyramid of Pepy I, King's Wife of the Pyramid of Merenre, King's Mother of the Pyramid of Pepy II"". Therefore, today, many Egyptologists believe that Pepi II was likely Merenre's own son. Pepi II would, therefore, be Pepi I's grandson while Merenre was, most likely, Pepi II's father since he is known to have married Pepi II's known mother, Queen Ankhesenpepi II. This would also conform well with the evidence from the South Saqqara Stone which shows no coregency between the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre thus making it far more likely that Pepi II was Merenre's own son. Pepi II's reign marked a sharp decline of the Old Kingdom. As the power of the nomarchs grew, the power of the pharaoh declined. With no dominant central power, local nobles began raiding each other's territories and the Old Kingdom came to an end within mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign.
Neith was an ancient Egyptian queen consort, one of the principal queens of the Old Kingdom pharaoh Pepi II Neferkare, who ruled (c. 2278 BC – c. 2184 BC). Queen Neith was named after goddess Neith.
Ankhesenpepi II or Ankhesenmeryre II was a queen consort during the sixth dynasty of Egypt. She was the wife of Kings Pepi I and Merenre Nemtyemsaf I, and the mother of Pepi II. She was buried in a pyramid in Saqqara.
Ankhesenpepi IV was an ancient Egyptian queen, a wife of Pharaoh Pepi II of the Sixth dynasty. She was the mother of King Neferkare II. Pepi II also had several other wives.

Context: Lions are frequently depicted on coats of arms, either as a device on shields or as supporters, but the lioness is used much less frequently. The formal language of heraldry, called blazon, employs French terms to describe the images precisely. Such descriptions specify whether lions or other creatures are ""rampant"" (rearing) or ""passant"" (crouching).Lions continue to appear in modern literature as characters including the messianic Aslan in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and following books from The Chronicles of Narnia series written by C. S. Lewis, and the comedic Cowardly Lion in L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Lion symbolism was used from the advent of cinema; one of the most iconic and widely recognised lions is Leo, which has been the mascot for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios since the 1920s. The 1960s saw the appearance of the Kenyan lioness Elsa in the movie Born Free, which is based on the factual book of the same title. The lion's role as king of the beasts has been used in cartoons, such as the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King, the 2005 DreamWorks animated character Alex in Madagascar, and the 2006 Disney animated character Samson in The Wild.

He and his sister Aemilia Lepida were both married to siblings of the Emperor Caligula (Aemilia married Caligula's elder brother Drusus Caesar; Lepidus married to Caligula's younger sister Julia Drusilla). He was also great-grandson of Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (consul of 50 BC and brother of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus). Some areas of his lineage are unclear. However, through his mother Julia the Younger, Lepidus was the great grandson of Emperor Augustus Caesar. Lepidus married Caligula's sister Drusilla sometime in November or December of 37. Little is known about him prior to this. Drusilla had been married to Lucius Cassius Longinus since 33 but Caligula forced his brother-in-law to divorce Drusilla so that she could marry Lepidus. The marriage lasted until Drusilla's death in June 38. They had no children. Because of this marriage, Lepidus had become a close friend to Caligula and his family. After the death of Gemellus in 37, Lepidus was publicly marked by Caligula as his heir. In late 38, when the governor of Egypt Aulus Avilius Flaccus was arrested, Lepidus successfully persuaded Caligula to exile Flaccus to Andros rather than Gyarus. Sometime in 39, however, Caligula made public letters by his sisters Agrippina the Younger and Julia Livilla that detailed an adulterous affair with Lepidus and a plot against the emperor. Lepidus was executed and Caligula's sisters were exiled. Agrippina was given the bones of Lepidus in an urn, and she carried them to Rome. Caligula sent three daggers to the Temple of Mars the Avenger to celebrate the death. In the Senate, Vespasian made a motion that the remains of Lepidus be thrown away instead of buried. The motion was carried and Lepidus was not given a proper burial.

Who is Charles Xiii Of Sweden's paternal grandfather?,"Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince of Eutin","[/INST] Yes I will reason and generate the answer </s><s>[INST] Question: Who is Charles Xiii Of Sweden's paternal grandfather?
Context: Charles VIII of Sweden (1408 Uppsala - 1470 Stockholm, in reality Charles II), Charles I of Norway, also Carl , was king of Sweden (1448–1457, 1464–1465 and from 1467 to his death in 1470) and king of Norway (1449–1450).
Charles XI, also Carl  (24 November 1655 – 5 April 1697 OS) was King of Sweden from 1660 until his death, in a period of Swedish history known as the Swedish Empire (1611–1718). He was the only son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. His father died when he was four years old, so Charles was educated by his governors until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon afterward, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country's neglected political, financial, and economic situation. He managed to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government, and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by his only son Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe. The fact that Charles was crowned as Charles XI does not mean that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles.

Charles XI, also Carl  (24 November 1655 – 5 April 1697 OS) was King of Sweden from 1660 until his death, in a period of Swedish history known as the Swedish Empire (1611–1718). He was the only son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. His father died when he was four years old, so Charles was educated by his governors until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon afterward, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country's neglected political, financial, and economic situation.

Who is the paternal grandfather of Eochaid Ailtlethan?,Connla Cáem,"[/INST] Yes I will reason and generate the answer </s><s>[INST] Question: Who is the paternal grandfather of Eochaid Ailtlethan?
Context: Eochaid (or Eochu) Ailtlethan (""broad blade""), son of Ailill Caisfiaclach, was, according to medieval Irish legends and historical traditions, a High King of Ireland. According to the ""Lebor Gabála Érenn"", he took the throne after overthrowing and killing the previous incumbent, Adamair, and ruled for eleven years, until he was killed in battle by Fergus Fortamail. The ""Lebor Gabála Érenn"" synchronises his reign with that of Ptolemy V Epiphanes in Egypt (204–181 BC). The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's ""Foras Feasa ar Éirinn"" dates his reign to 285–274 BC, that of the ""Annals of the Four Masters"" (which gives him a reign of seventeen years) to 414–396 BC.
Nath Í, also known as Dathí, son of Fiachrae, son of Eochaid Mugmedon, was a semi-historical Irish king of the 5th century, the father of the likely-historical king Ailill Molt and the ancestor of the Uí Fiachrach dynasties of early medieval Connacht. According to legend, he was a High King of Ireland, and died after being struck by lightning while on an expedition to the Alps.
Airechtach ua Dunchadh Muirsce( ???–730) was a king of Ui Fiachrach Muaidhe. Airechtach was a grandson of Dúnchad Muirisci. However, unlike his grandfather, he never became King of Connacht.
Eochu Buadach, son of Dui Ladrach, was, according to some redactions or versions of Lebor Gabála Érenn, a High King of Ireland. But he is not included as a High King in other versions of the story. He was the father of two High Kings of Ireland, Ugaine Mor, and Bodbchad.
Eochaid mac Áeda Find is a spurious King of Dál Riata found in some rare High Medieval king-lists and in older history books. Supposedly a son of Áed Find (died 778) and successor to Áed's brother Fergus mac Echdach, Eochaid is now thought to represent a misplacing of the reign of Eochaid mac Echdach. The reigns of Selbach mac Ferchair, Dúngal mac Selbaig and, perhaps, Alpín mac Echdach, are similarly misplaced in the sources which contain this Eochaid.

Where was the place of burial of Pareherwenemef's mother?,QV66,,False,"Both Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef and Nubkheperre Intef were sons of a king called Sobekemsaf, most probably Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf (Sobekemsaf II today, not I) based on an inscription from a doorjamb from a 17th Dynasty temple at Gebel Antef. While his own tomb has not been located, it was likely located in the area of Dra' Abu el-Naga' where the pyramid tomb of his brother Nubkheperre Intef was found in 2001. The pyramidion of the pyramid of Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef's pyramid was found in Dra' Abu el-Naga'. It has a slope of 60 degrees and is inscribed with this king's names. The pyramidion is now in the British Museum (BM EA 478).
Kekheretnebti or Khekeretnebty was a Princess of Egypt, who lived during the Fifth Dynasty. Her father was Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi. Kekheretnebti was buried in a mastaba ('B') in the royal necropolis at Abusir, south-east of the mortuary temple of Niuserre. Her skeletal remains show that she was a slender woman of 30–35 years when she died. Originally the mastaba belonged only to Kekheretnebti but later on the tomb was reconstructed and enlarged on the northern side to include a second burial, that of Kekheretnebti's daughter Tisethor, who had barely reached the age of puberty. Kekheretnebti was a full sister of princess Hedjetnebu who was buried in a tomb nearby. The examination of the skeletal remains show that the sisters showed some similarities and were both clearly related to Djedkare Isesi. Archaeological evidence shows that Kekheretnebti's tomb was constructed first, soon followed by the construction of the tomb of her sister Hedjetnebu. A scribe to the royal children named Idu had a tomb constructed a short time after the tomb construction for the princesses.

Isetnofret was an Ancient Egyptian woman and daughter of the high priest of Ptah and king's son Khaemweset( lived around 1200 BC). She appears on two monuments close to her father. On a statue of Khaemweset found at Medinet Madi she is shown on the back pillar and called"" daughter of his body"". On a relief found at Saqqara she is called"" his beloved daughter"" and"" king's daughter"". Evidently she was not the daughter of a king, but was the granddaughter of king Ramses II, as Khaemweset was the son of the latter. Isetnofret was most likely buried at Saqqara close to a monument dedicated to Khaemweset. There a tomb was discovered with a huge limestone sarcophagus that is inscribed for the"" noble woman"" Isetnofret. The place of the tomb next to the building dedicated to Khaemwaset, makes it very likely that this is the burial of his daughter Isetnofret.

Flair triumphantly returned to WCW as a hero in February 1993, as a result of a ``no - compete ''clause he was unable to wrestle, so he hosted a short - lived talk show in WCW called A Flair for the Gold. Arn Anderson usually appeared at the bar on the show's set, and Flair's maid Fifi cleaned or bore gifts. Once he returned to action, Flair briefly held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship for a tenth time after defeating Barry Windham at Beach Blast before WCW finally left the NWA in September 1993. At Fall Brawl, Flair lost the title, now rebranded the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship, to`` Ravishing Rick'' Rude. At Starrcade in 1993, Flair defeated Vader to win the WCW World Heavyweight title for the second time. In the spring of 1994, Flair began a tweener turn and started another feud with longtime rival Ricky Steamboat and challenged Steamboat to a match at Spring Stampede which ended in a no contest from a double pin, causing the title to be held up. Flair then defeated Steamboat in a rematch to reclaim the held - up title on an episode of WCW Saturday Night. The WWE does not count this victory as a new title win. Flair then challenged Col. Robert Parker to wrestle one of his men at Slamboree, which turned out to be Barry Windham, whom Flair defeated, afterwards he quietly turned heel and took Sherri Martel as his manager. He would also wrestle Lord Steven Regal in a five - match series under Marquess of Queensberry Rules, which aired on WCW Worldwide between April 30 and May 28, in which Flair won the series, with 2 wins, 1 loss, and 2 draws.

The term Oceania is often used to denote the region encompassing the Australian continent and various islands in the Pacific Ocean that are not included in the seven - continent model.
Funafuti is an atoll and the capital of the island nation of Tuvalu. It has a population of 6,025 people, making it the country's most populated atoll, with 56.6 percent of Tuvalu's population. It is a narrow sweep of land between 20 and 400 metres (66 and 1,312 feet) wide, encircling a large lagoon (Te Namo) 18 km (11 miles) long and 14 km (9 miles) wide. The average depth in the Funafuti lagoon is about 20 fathoms (36.5 metres or 120 feet). With a surface of 275 square kilometres (106.2 sq mi), it is by far the largest lagoon in Tuvalu. The land area of the 33 islets aggregates to 2.4 square kilometres (0.9 sq mi), less than one percent of the total area of the atoll. Cargo ships can enter Funafuti's lagoon and dock at the port facilities on Fongafale.

Dialogues of Exiles is a 1975 French- Chilean satirical film with documentary elements directed by Raúl Ruiz.
Baradwaj Rangan wrote ""The signature achievement of ""Goli Soda"" is its ruthless unmasking of how hollow most of our masala movies are, and how, with a little imagination, just a little, you can make a film which does not insult the audience"" and went on to state, ""I will be very surprised if there's a more entertaining, more inventive, more well-acted masala movie this year"". The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and said """"Goli Soda"" IS a masala movie. But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists aren't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents, early teens to be specific.

It was nominated for four David di Donatello, for best new director, best actor, best actress and best supporting actor( Filippo Nigro) and for three Nastri d'argento, for best comedy film, best script and best producer.
Baradwaj Rangan wrote ""The signature achievement of ""Goli Soda"" is its ruthless unmasking of how hollow most of our masala movies are, and how, with a little imagination, just a little, you can make a film which does not insult the audience"" and went on to state, ""I will be very surprised if there's a more entertaining, more inventive, more well-acted masala movie this year"". The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and said """"Goli Soda"" IS a masala movie. But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists aren't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents, early teens to be specific. There have been Hollywood films that have transposed the sensibilities of a regular genre movie to ones that have kids as the principal characters...but this is probably a first in Tamil cinema"". Sify called it ""a gutsy and outstanding film"" and continued, ""The film works due to the triumph of honest writing, freshness of its cast who does not have any star trappings, and the speed of the film.

Context: In the published version of ""The Silmarillion"", Orodreth () was an Elf of the First Age, the second son of Finarfin (with Finrod Felagund, Angrod, Aegnor, and Galadriel being his siblings), and a ruler of Nargothrond.
Finarfin was the third son and youngest child of Finwë. Finarfin's mother was Finwë's second wife Indis. Fëanor was his half-brother and Fingolfin his full brother. His sisters were Findis and Irimë. He married Eärwen, princess of the Teleri. He had four children: Finrod Felagund, Angrod, Aegnor and Galadriel. Orodreth appears as one of Finarfin's sons in the published ""Silmarillion""; in Tolkien's later writings however he clearly is Angrod's son. Christopher Tolkien used an older version of the genealogy in the ""Silmarillion"", but later described this as a mistake. Finarfin was said to be the fairest and wisest of Finwë's sons. Like all of Finwë's sons, Finarfin founded his own house. Uniquely among the Noldor he and his descendants all had golden hair inherited from his mother, so his house was sometimes called ""The Golden House of Finarfin"".
Grimoald II( died 714), called the Younger, was the mayor of the palace of Neustria from 695.

While en route to visit the tomb of Saint Lambert at Liège, he was assassinated by a certain Rangar, in the employ of his father- in- law. His sons carried on a fight to be recognised as Pepin of Herstal's true heirs, since Grimoald predeceased his father and his half- brother Charles Martel usurped the lands and offices of their father. In short, he was innocent but unlucky.
Grimoald I( 616–657), called the Elder( in French,"" Grimaud l' Ainé""), was the Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia from 640 to 656. He was the son of Pepin of Landen and Itta.

Renegades were a British rock band which started out as a side- project from two members of the band Feeder, featuring guitarist Grant Nicholas and bassist Taka Hirose, before becoming a pseudonym name for Feeder themselves. Nicholas formed Renegades alongside Hirose with Karl Brazil from Ben's Brother, who completed the group and a four- track EP was then recorded.

Brazil was initially contracted with the band to assist them on their June dates playing various university events, before then playing the UK leg of the Sonisphere Festival. He was however recording with the band alongside Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter, before the idea came about to use a selection of the tracks for the' Renegades' project.

On the first of January 2010, a four- day countdown timer was added to the band's official website.

Context: Álvaro of Lencastre( 1540 – 1626) was the son of Afonso of Lencastre, second son of infante George of Lencastre, 2nd Duke of Coimbra.
Jorge de Lencastre, or George of Lencastre( Azeitão, 1594 – Lisbon, 1632) was the older son of Dom Álvaro and Juliana of Lencastre, 3rd Dukes of Aveiro. As heir of the Dukes of Aveiro, he was 3rd Marquis of Torres Novas and, due to King Philip I ’s special grant, he also became the 1st Duke of Torres Novas. However, he never inherited the Dukedom of Aveiro, once he died before his mother. He married twice:
His full name was Gabriel de Lencastre Ponce de León Manrique de Lara Cádenas Girón y Aragon( 1667 – 1745), known as"" Dom"" Gabriel of Lencastre. He was the 2nd son of Manuel Ponce de León, 6th Duke of Los Arcos, in Spain, and Maria de Guadalupe of Lencastre, 6th Duchess of Aveiro. His mother was recognised by the Portuguese King, as Duchess of Aveiro, in 1679, on the condition she would return to Portugal. Due to her husband's opposition, she divorced him, returned to her homeland and regained the House of Aveiro and their estates. Their elder son, Don Joaquín, would inherited the Spanish House of the Dukes of Los Arcos, while the younger, Dom Gabriel, would inherited the Portuguese House of the Dukes of Aveiro. Only after his mother's death( 1715), he came to Portugal. While he lived in Spain, King Charles II granted him the title of Duke of Baños, and he served in the Spanish army, both in the Catalonia and in the Flanders campaigns. He died single without issue. After his death the Duchy was claimed by his nephew, António de Lencastre Ponce de León( son of Joaquin 7th Duke of Los Arcos), and by José de Mascarenhas, 8th Count of Santa Cruz and 5th Marquis of Gouveia( descending from Álvaro and Juliana of Lencastre through female line).
Pedro de Lencastre, or Peter of Lencastre( Azeitão, 1608 – Lisbon, 1673), was the youngest son of Álvaro and Juliana of Lencastre, 3rd Dukes of Aveiro. He studied theology in the University of Coimbra and he became successively Bishop of Guarda, Archbishop of Évora and Archbishop of Braga. In spite of the Portuguese revolution against the Spanish Habsburgs, his nephew, Raimundo of Lencastre, 4th Duke of Aveiro actively supported the rights of the Habsburg Kings and, in 1663, the new King of the Braganza Dynasty, John IV, decided to confiscate the Dukedom. However, Peter of Lencastre, a Braganza supporter, requested the cancellation of this decision and, finally in 1668, he was recognised as 5th Duke of Aveiro and Marquis of Torres Novas. Later the same year, when the peace between Portugal and Spain was signed, Peter's niece, Maria de Guadalupe of Lencastre, sister and heir of the 4th Duke, requested the cancellation of the decision that granted the Dukedom of Aveiro to her uncle, in order to obtain it for herself. Due to Peter of Lencastre's death in 1673, Maria de Guadalupe of Lencastre, still living in Spain, was recognised as the new Duchess of Aveiro on condition she would return to Portugal.
Jorge de Lencastre, or George of Lencastre (1548–1578), was the older son of Dom John of Lencastre, 1st Duke of Aveiro and of his wife Juliana de Lara, daughter of the 3rd Marquis of Vila Real. Until his father's death, he used the title of Marquis of Torres Novas, and also succeeded him as 2nd Duke of Aveiro in 1571. He was a close adviser to King Sebastian I of Portugal and he escorted him, both to the Guadalupe interview (where Sebastian met his uncle, King Philip II of Spain) and to the Portuguese campaign to Morocco. George was killed in the Battle of Alcácer Quibir, together with the King, in 1578.

Context: Lars Gustafsson Vasa( born 1 September 1586 in Silesia died 1660)- fictional son of Prince Gustav of Sweden with his supposed wife Brita Karth. According to the legend, in 1621 he married Brita Törnros. They were earlier thought to be the parents of Lars Eldstjerna and Samuel Stjerneld, founders of the Swedish noble families of Eldstierna and Stierneld respectively. Modern scholars have however refuted this myth and Lars and Samuel are nowadays identified as the sons of a vogt at Händelö named Lars( died 1657), whose possible patronym might have been Björnsson.
Gustav Vasas intåg i Stockholm 1523 (or Gustav Vasa enters Stockholm 1523) is a painting painted for the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm by the Swedish painter Carl Larsson. It was completed in 1908. The painting depicts Gustav Vasa of Sweden as he is about to enter Stockholm in 1523 to be king.
Lorentz Creutz (16151 June 1676) was a Swedish ""friherre"" (roughly equivalent to a baron), government administrator, county governor (""landshövding"") of Kopparberg County (1655–62), member of the Privy Council and supreme commander of the Swedish navy for a few months in 1676. He successfully served as an administrator in the Treasury in later years and was appointed as navy commander in early 1676 during the Scanian War. However, his complete lack of naval military experience combined with the generally poor state of the Swedish fleet led to his death on ""Kronan"", the flagship of the navy, at the battle of Öland on 1 June 1676. Creutz married the ""friherrinna"" (roughly baroness) Elsa Duwall (1620–1675), daughter of general Jakob MacDougall (ennobled as ""Duvall"") and Anna von der Berge.
Prof Magnus Gustaf( or Gustav) Retzius FRSFor HFRSE MSA( 17 October 1842 – 21 July 1919) was a Swedish physician and anatomist who dedicated a large part of his life to researching the histology of the sense organs and nervous system.
Carl Gustaf Creutz (1660−1728) was a Swedish general. Carl Gustaf Creutz was the youngest son of Lorentz Creutz Sr. and Elsa Jacob Daughter Duwall. He served as a page of Charles XI and experienced the Scanian War. By 1691 he was a captain in the Household Cavalry Regiment under Charles XII. The Great Northern War began in 1700 and Creutz landing in Zealand. He distinguished himself at the battles of Petschora and Kletsh (in present-day Poland). Promotions to major and lieutenant colonel then came quickly. Creutz became a colonel in 1704. The Battle of Poltava in 1709 brought Creutz command of the entire cavalry. However, he had to surrender soon after Perevolotnya. After Count Piper's death, he was the senior Swedish prisoner in Russia, of which his extant correspondence bears visible witness. In 1722, he was able to return to Sweden and service in the cavalry.

She was born at Vitré, Ille-et-Vilaine, the daughter of Guy XVI de Laval, count of Laval, and of Charlotte of Aragon, Princess of Taranto. She was the only child of Charlotte to marry and leave heirs, thereby continuing the line of descent of Frederick of Naples. On 23 January 1521 she married François de la Trémoïlle, ""vicomte"" de Thouars.

It is also said that she inherited the barony of Laz, as well, although Père Anselme's genealogy of her family makes no mention of it. She died at Craon, aged 48 or 49.

The Great Unravel is the third studio album by folk rock group Gandalf Murphy and the Slambovian Circus of Dreams.
""Unravel"" is the third song on the album ""Homogenic"" by Björk, which was released in 1997. The song features a prominent example of Björk's use of a half-singing, half-speaking technique which, according to folklore specialist Njall Sigurason, is comparable to that of Old Icelandic choirmen.

Who is Shepseskare's paternal grandmother?,Khentkaus II,,False,"This is a list of the characters that appear in"" The Tale of the Heike"".
Shepseskaf was the sixth and last pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt during the Old Kingdom. He reigned 6 to 8 years starting circa 2510 BC. The only activities firmly datable to his reign are the completion of the temple complex of the Pyramid of Menkaure and the construction of its own mastaba tomb at South Saqqara, the Mastabat al-Fir’aun, ""stone bench of the pharaoh"".
Shepseskare or Shepseskara (Egyptian for ""Noble is the Soul of Ra"") was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the fourth or fifth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty (2494–2345 BC) during the Old Kingdom period. Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.

Margaret's father, Otto, had no sons, so at his death in 1328, the County of Ravensberg went to his younger brother Bernhard. However, when Bernhard died in 1346 without issue, Margaret became the heiress of Ravensberg, her elder sister and only sibling, Hedwig, having died in 1336. Then, when Margaret's uncle, Adolf IX of Berg, died in 1348 without issue, Margaret also inherited Berg by right of her mother, since Margaret was Adolf's only surviving niece. As a result of her marriage to Gerhard VI of Jülich, Berg and Ravensberg passed into the house of Jülich where they remained until 1511 when they passed into the house of Cleves.",

In their July, 2009 journal, Camilo José Cela University compared his works to that of Truffaut and Comencini. He originally started in the arts by writing and performing his own musical compositions. The transition from music to film came from his love for combining and juxtaposing the two art forms in order to make something greater than the two by themselves.

Yakov Iosifovich Dzhugashvili (– 14 April 1943) was the eldest of Joseph Stalin's three children, the son of Stalin's first wife, Kato Svanidze, who died 9 months after his birth. His father, then a young revolutionary in his mid-20s, left the child to be raised by his late wife's family.

Disregarded by Stalin, Dzhugashvili was a shy, quiet child who appeared quite unhappy and tried to commit suicide several times as a youth.

Dzhugashvili studied to become an engineer, then — on his father's insistence — he enrolled in training to be an artillery officer.

Who is Sobe (Sister Of Saint Anne)'s grandchild?,John the Baptist,"[/INST] Yes I will reason and generate the answer </s><s>[INST] Question: Who is Sobe (Sister Of Saint Anne)'s grandchild?
Context: According to apocryphal Christian and Islamic tradition, Saint Anne was the mother of Mary and the maternal grandmother of Jesus. Mary's mother is not named in the canonical gospels. In writing, Anne's name and that of her husband Joachim come only from New Testament apocrypha, of which the Gospel of James (written perhaps around 150) seems to be the earliest that mentions them. The mother of Mary is mentioned, but not named, in the Quran.
Sobekhotep was the son of the 'god's father' Haankhef and of the 'king's mother' Kemi. His grandfather was the soldier of the town's regiment Nehy. His grandmother was called Senebtysy. Sobekhotep might have had several wives, only one of which is known for certain, the ""king's wife"" Tjan. Several children are known. These are Amenhotep and Nebetiunet, both with Tjan as mother. There are three further king's sons: Sobekhotep Miu, Sobekhotep Djadja and Haankhef Iykhernofret. Their mother is not recorded in extant sources.
Sobe, also known as Sovin, was the mother of St. Elizabeth and sister of St. Anne. The Bible records only that Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron and a cousin (or relative) of Mary. The name of Sobe first appears in writings of about the 8th century by Hippolytus of Thebes, Andrew of Crete, and Epiphanius Monachus, and later in Nicephorus Callistus and Andronicus.

The eldest being married in Bethlehem, had for daughter Salome the midwife; Sobe the second likewise married in Bethlehem, and was the mother of Elizabeth; last of all the third married in Galilee, and brought forth Mary the mother of Christ. The 19th-century mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich claims that according to her visions (which give a detailed genealogy of Mary), Sobe was a sister of Anne, but the mother of Elizabeth was Emerentia, Sobe and Anne's maternal aunt.

""Northwest Passage"" is one of the best-known songs by Canadian musician Stan Rogers. An a cappella song, it features Rogers alone singing the verses, with several guest vocalists harmonizing with him in the chorus. It is not to be confused with the big band tune of the same name by Ralph Burns.
``Where Have All the Flowers Gone? ''is a modern folk - style song. The melody and the first three verses were written by Pete Seeger in 1955 and published in Sing Out! magazine. Additional verses were added in May 1960 by Joe Hickerson, who turned it into a circular song. Its rhetorical`` where?'' and meditation on death place the song in the ubi sunt tradition. In 2010, the New Statesman listed it as one of the ``Top 20 Political Songs ''.
The first recorded attempt to discover the Northwest Passage was the east - west voyage of John Cabot in 1497, sent by Henry VII in search of a direct route to the Orient. In 1524, Charles V sent Estêvão Gomes to find a northern Atlantic passage to the Spice Islands. An English expedition was launched in 1576 by Martin Frobisher, who took three trips west to what is now the Canadian Arctic in order to find the passage. Frobisher Bay, which he first charted, is named after him.
"" Where Are You?"" is a popular song composed by Jimmy McHugh, with lyrics by Harold Adamson.

Gwladys ferch Dafydd Gam( died 1454) was a Welsh noblewoman. She was the daughter of Dafydd ap Llewelyn ap Hywel, otherwise known as Dafydd Gam, who was killed at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Gwladys was named"" the star of Abergavenny Gwladys the happy and the faultless"" by Welsh poet Lewys Glyn Cothi. He describes the lady of Raglan Castle, which she became upon her second marriage, as a brilliant being,"" like the sun—the pavilion of light."" She has been compared to the legendary Queen Marcia for her discretion and influence.
Gwladys ferch Dafydd was the daughter of Dafydd ap Gruffudd, the last free Prince of Wales, and Elizabeth Ferrers. She probably spent most of her early life in the company of her father in England and Gwynedd. Upon the death of his brother Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, on 10 December 1282, Dafydd ap Gruffydd briefly took over as Prince of Wales. Hearing the news, Edward I gathered his forces to unseat the newly named prince. Dafydd, his family and a few stalwart supporters went into hiding in the forests of Snowdonia. Sensing a losing effort, most of his countrymen gave up hope of continuing the Gwynedd regime. In June 1283, Gwladys was arrested with her father, mother, brothers (Llywelyn and Owain) and sisters. Dafydd was hanged, drawn and quartered for treason. Dafydd's sons were imprisoned. Gwladys was dispatched to the Gilbertine convent in Sixhills, Lincolnshire, as a young child. Edward I ordered annual payment of 20 pounds for Gwladys's upkeep at the Sixhills convent, where she spent the remainder of her life. She is thought to have died there in 1336, outliving her brothers. She is known to have had sisters, who were illegitimate. Their names and fates are unknown, but Edward I considered sending them to Lincolnshire convents; whether he did so is not entirely clear.
